# Face-recognition-using-KNN-SVC-TensorFlow
In this face recognition project, we are provided with a dataset of images. Aim of the project is to classify the photos as Bush and Not Bush, Williams and not Serena Williams (binary classification). There are 13,233 photos in all which include photos of Bush, Williams and other photos as well. These are gray-scale photos with pixel count being 64x64. The project provided us with X.csv file which contains 13,233 photos and 4096 pixel resolution count (among which we pick necessary features). So, in the X.csv file, each row corresponds to a photo and each column corresponds to pixels. We are also provided with y_bush_vs_others.csv which contains label 1 for actual Bush photos and 0 otherwise and y_williams_vs_others.csv file which contains a 1 as label for actual Williams photo and 0 otherwise. Initially, I played around with the data by loading the images and visualizing the same. Data in X.csv was initially split into X_train, y_train, X_test and y_test. Different performance metrics like F1, Precision, Recall, Accuracy were calculated for different models.
